# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed
- The Tools menu entry is translated again. `main.lua` took `_` from
  KOReader's `gettext`, which knows nothing of this plugin's strings, so the
  menu label stayed English while the game's own screen, which goes through
  `i18n`, was translated. `_` now comes from `i18n` here too.


## [1.2.1] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed
- Picks up game-common v1.5.0. Play statistics were recorded under a key no
  tool could match: `ReaderUI`/`FileManager:registerModule()` rewrite a plugin
  instance's `name` to `reader<id>` / `filemanager<id>` right after it is
  built, so this game's sessions were split across two rows and neither
  carried its plugin id. Rows written under the old keys are merged back on
  first read. The same release brings the `stopPlugin()` /
  `deletePluginSettings()` hooks KOReader 2026.07 calls when a plugin is
  deleted from the device (PR #15240).

  No change to this plugin's own code -- it inherits all of it from the
  shared library.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- **Hint** button. Two taps: the first says which cell is about to give, the
  second acts on it. A cell that contradicts the solution is always reported
  before a fresh one is revealed.

## [1.1.12] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- Generated puzzles had no uniqueness verification — the tree positions
  and row/column tent-count clues shipped as soon as one valid tent
  placement was found, with no check that they pinned down that
  placement uniquely. Measured pre-fix ambiguity of roughly 60-87% unique
  across sizes/difficulties (worse at hard). Added a backtracking
  uniqueness solver and reworked generation to retry the tree/tent
  pairing until one is proven unique. Puzzles are now 20/20 unique at
  every size/difficulty in regression testing, with generation staying
  near-instant.
